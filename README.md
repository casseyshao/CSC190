# CSC190 Computer Algorithms and Data Structures

**Lab 1:** Stacks and using stacks to build a parenthesis checker (Python and C).

**Lab 2:** Defining classes for the general tree and binary tree, and converting between the two (Python).

**Lab 3:** Binary Search Trees (treesort) and Self-Balancing AVL Trees (rotations) (C).

**Lab 4:** Heap traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder), adding elements to the heap, finding the existence of an element with a specified key value in the heap, and removing the max value (C). Hash function (Python).

**Lab 5:** Graph class that includes a function to add vertices to the graph, add directed/undirected and weighted edges to the graph, do a breadth/depth traversal of the graph, check for connectivity between two vertices, and find the path between two connected vertices (Python).

**Lab 6:** Applications of Bit Manipulation: a programming prototype for a linear feedback shift register (LFSR), and a programming prototype for a simple encryption/decryption algorithm.

**Lab 7:** Implementing sorting algorithms: selection sort, heap sort, and merge sort (Python).

**Lab 8:** Bubble sort using a function pointer, priority queue (heap) implementation, and heap sort (C). Radix sort (Python).
